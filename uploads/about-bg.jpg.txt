# About Banner Image

This is a placeholder text file since we can't directly upload images through this interface.

When implementing the website, please:

1. Create an "uploads" directory in your website root if it doesn't already exist
2. Place an appropriate banner image named "about-bg.jpg" in the uploads directory
3. The image should be landscape orientation, preferably at least 1600px wide

You can use the image from the provided screenshot or any other suitable image for a travel website's About page.
